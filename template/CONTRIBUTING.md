```

### Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples

```
feat: add user profile screen
fix: resolve memory leak in image component
docs: update installation instructions
style: format code according to prettier rules
refactor: extract common validation logic
test: add unit tests for auth service
chore: update react-native to 0.75.5
```

## Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names with the following format:

- `feature/description` - for new features
- `fix/description` - for bug fixes
- `refactor/description` - for refactoring
- `docs/description` - for documentation updates

Examples:

- `feature/user-authentication`
- `fix/login-crash`
- `refactor/api-service`
- `docs/coding-conventions`

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Write unit tests for all utility functions
- Test React components using React Native Testing Library
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Place test files next to the code they test or in `__tests__` folders

### Integration Tests

- Test complete user flows
- Test navigation between screens
- Test API integrations with mock data

### Manual Testing

- Test on both iOS and Android devices
- Test on different screen sizes
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Verify accessibility features

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Document complex functions with JSDoc comments
- Add inline comments for complex business logic
- Update README.md if you add new features or change setup process

### API Documentation

- Document new API endpoints
- Update existing API documentation when making changes
- Include example requests and responses

## Issue Reporting
